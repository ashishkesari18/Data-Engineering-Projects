# 🔐 Key Risk Project– Predictive Access Risk Engine for Amazon Smart Deliveries

Amazon Key allows secure in-home, in-garage, and in-business deliveries. But what if a driver’s behavior hints at a potential breach or operational failure?

KeyRisk is a real-time predictive engine that flags risky driver unlock behavior — like repeated failures, late-night access, and suspicious delivery routes.
