# ðŸ“Š AthenaX â€“ Leadership & Mentorship Insights

**AthenaX** is a real-time serverless dashboard built to deliver powerful insights into employee leadership scores, mentorship completions, and promotion patterns using AWS-native tools. This interactive dashboard is designed to support HR leadership teams in making data-driven talent decisions at Amazon scale.

---

## Project Overview

The AthenaX pipeline processes employee signals (like mentorship completions, leadership scores, and promotions) through a robust ETL workflow. The final, aggregated data is visualized through an elegant and professional Streamlit dashboard.

The dashboard answers key business questions like:
- Who are the top employees with high leadership scores but no promotions?
- Which employees completed mentorships but were overlooked for promotion?
- What does the promotion-readiness matrix look like across the org?
